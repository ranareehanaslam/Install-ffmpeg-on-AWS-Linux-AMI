# FFmpeg Installation on AWS Linux AMI

This guide provides instructions on how to install FFmpeg on an AWS Linux AMI. FFmpeg is a comprehensive multimedia framework capable of decoding, encoding, transcoding, muxing, demuxing, streaming, filtering, and playing pretty much anything that humans and machines have created.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have full administrative privileges on your AWS Linux AMI to execute the `sudo` commands.

## Installation Steps

1. **Gain Root Access**  
   Start by switching to the root user to ensure you have the necessary permissions:

   ```sh
   sudo su -
   ```

2. **Navigate to Local Bin Directory**  
   Move to the `/usr/local/bin` directory where we will download and extract FFmpeg:

   ```sh
   cd /usr/local/bin
   ```

3. **Create FFmpeg Directory**  
   Within `/usr/local/bin`, create a new directory for FFmpeg:

   ```sh
   mkdir ffmpeg
   ```

4. **Download FFmpeg**  
   Change to the `ffmpeg` directory and download the FFmpeg static build:

   ```sh
   cd ffmpeg
   wget https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/releases/ffmpeg-release-amd64-static.tar.xz
   ```

5. **Extract the Tarball**  
   Extract the downloaded tarball:

   ```sh
   tar xvf ffmpeg-release-amd64-static.tar.xz
   ```

6. **Move FFmpeg Binary**  
   Move the FFmpeg binary to the current directory:

   ```sh
   mv ffmpeg-6.0-amd64-static/ffmpeg .
   ```

7. **Create Symlink**  
   Create a symbolic link to the FFmpeg binary in `/usr/bin` for easy access:

   ```sh
   ln -s /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg/ffmpeg /usr/bin/ffmpeg
   ```

8. **Exit Root User**  
   After installation, exit the root user mode:

   ```sh
   exit
   ```

## Verifying the Installation

After installation, you can verify that FFmpeg has been installed correctly by checking its version:

```sh
ffmpeg -version
```

This command should output the version of FFmpeg that was installed, along with its configuration details.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the installation, please ensure that:

- You have an active internet connection.
- The URL provided for the FFmpeg tarball is accessible and not outdated.
